***Problem Statement***



-> Description
Currently in schools teachers perform manual work to prepare and track students learningâ€™s outcome through report cards. This is the standard procedure done manually throughout the country. Often it is observed that students are also good in co-curricular activities and being good in academics is not the only way ahead. In current situation it is not possible for a teacher to pay attention to every student and find out the best in a child. Hence there is a need to develop solutions to track all activities of a student including the academic progress in real-time. Innovation in this domain will be appreciated to develop systems which automatically reads the students progress and generates feedback also is a good way to proceed.
